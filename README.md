# Replay Viewer
This goes with the Reanimator project (https://github.com/WaterfallEngineering/reanimator) and is currently only supported by the branch here: https://github.com/adamblackburn/reanimator/tree/reanimator-prune.

It receives replay logs as POSTs and contains the necessary glue to allow them to be replayed at the correct size.

Watch a demo here: http://replay-viewer.appspot.com/replay/do/fAaBPd
